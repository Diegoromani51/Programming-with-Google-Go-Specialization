This last module ties together the various features – including threads, concurrency, and synchronization – covered in this course. The week’s programming assignment requires you to use concurrent algorithms in the implementation of the “dining philosopher’s problem and then address the ensuing synchronization issues.
# Learning Objectives
- Identify the uses of channels and how they are implemented in code.
- Identify the purpose of the “select” keyword and the meaning of “default clause.”
- Identify the definition of “mutual exclusion” and characteristics of a “deadlock."
- Develop a goroutine that makes use of concurrent algorithms and addresses synchronization issues.
