In this module, you’ll work with threaded goroutines and explore the benefits of synchronization. The week’s assignment has you using a threaded approach to create a program that sorts integers via four separate sub-arrays, then merging the arrays into a single array.
# Learning Objectives
- Identify features and operational characteristics of goroutines.
- Identify reasons for introducing synchronization in a goroutine.
- Write a goroutine that uses threads to sort integers via four sub-arrays that are then merged into a single array.
