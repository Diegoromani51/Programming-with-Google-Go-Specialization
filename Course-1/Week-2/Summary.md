Now that you’ve set up your programming environment and written a test program, you’re ready to dive into data types. This module introduces data types in Go and gives you practice writing routines that manipulate different kinds of data objects, including floating-point numbers and strings.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe the fundamental data types in Go.
- Explain how program flow is controlled in Go.
- Describe the process of garbage collection.
- Write and implement a Go program that manipulates floating-point numbers and performs truncation.
- Write and implement a Go program that manipulates strings.
