The goal of this assignment is to practice working with floating point numbers and truncation code in Go.

# PROMPT
Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered. Truncation is the process of removing the digits to the right of the decimal place.

Submit your source code for the program, “trunc.go”.
