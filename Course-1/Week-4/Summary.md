This final module of the course introduces the use of remote function calls (RFCs) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in Go. Youâ€™ll learn how to access and manipulate data from external files, and have an opportunity to write several routines using Go that exercise this functionality.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe remote function calls (RFCs).
- Describe JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
- Describe methods for accessing data in files.
- Write and implement a Go program that employs RFCs and JSON.
- Write and implement a Go program that reads structured text data from a file and then performs some manipulations with those data.
