Functions in Go have many useful and powerful capabilities, which you’ll explore in this module. At the end, you’ll develop a Go routine that takes full advantage of Go’s object orientation.
# Learning Objectives
- Identify the basic properties and uses of objects and classes.
- Identify the differences between structs (in Go) and classes (in an object-oriented language).
- Identify the uses of methods and different data types.
- Develop an interactive Go routine that uses classes, objects, instances, structs, and methods to query the properties of existing instances.
