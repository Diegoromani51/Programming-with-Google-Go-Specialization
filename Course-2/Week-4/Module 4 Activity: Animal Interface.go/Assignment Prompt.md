The goal of this assignment is to write a GoLang routine that allows users to create a set of animals and then get information about those animals.

# PROMPT
Write a program which allows the user to create a set of animals and to get information about those animals. Each animal has a name and can be either a cow, bird, or snake. With each command, the user can either create a new animal of one of the three types, or the user can request information about an animal that he/she has already created. Each animal has a unique name, defined by the user. Note that the user can define animals of a chosen type, but the types of animals are restricted to either cow, bird, or snake. The following table contains the three types of animals and their associated data.
