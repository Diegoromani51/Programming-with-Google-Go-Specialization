This last module rounds out the course by introducing several new concepts including interfaces and polymorphism. You’ll finish the module – and course – by creating a Go routine that creates instances of a class and allows you to query its properties.
# Learning Objectives
- Identify the basic characteristics and features of interfaces in Go.
- Identify the characteristics of polymorphism.
- Identify the features associated with overriding and inheritance.
- Develop an interactive Go routine that uses classes, objects, instances, structs, and methods to create new class instances and later query their properties.
