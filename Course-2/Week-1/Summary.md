Continue your exploration of the Go programming language as you learn about functions, methods, and interfaces. Topics include the implementation of functions, function types, object-orientation in Go, methods, and class instantiation. As with the first course in this series, you’ll have an opportunity to create your own Go applications so you can practice what you’re learning. The first module introduces the concept of functions and shows you how to use them to manipulate data programmatically. Once again, the treatment of the topic begins at a fairly rudimentary level to ensure everyone is starting from the same point in terms of basic concepts.
# Learning Objectives
- Identify the basic features and purposes of functions.
- Identify the benefits of using pointers when working with functions.
- Identify the difference between passing a slice and an array as function arguments.
- Use functions and a slice to implement a sorting routine for integers.
